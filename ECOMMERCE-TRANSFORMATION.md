## 💡 How It Works

### Data Flow:
```
1. Component loads → fetches products.json
2. flattenProducts() transforms hierarchical data
3. Products rendered as cards in grid
4. User applies filters/sort → applyFilters()
5. filteredProducts array updated
6. Grid re-renders with filtered results
```

### Architecture:
```
modern-product-catalog.js (Web Component)
├── Data Layer (products, filteredProducts)
├── Filtering Logic (category, price, search)
├── Sorting Logic (name, price)
├── Rendering (cards, modal)
└── Event Handlers (clicks, inputs, changes)
```

## 📱 Mobile Experience

The catalog is fully responsive:
- Filters stack vertically on mobile
- Cards adjust to single column
- Touch-friendly targets (44px minimum)
- Modal scrolls properly on small screens
